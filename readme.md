## PYTHON && C++ Comparison
Yes i compraed c++ and python, might not be accurate since c++ script is more optimized than python's.
I conducted both test on different platforms just to make sure it doesnt only work on my pc. Also I rounded up the numbers by 3 figures so they're entirely accurate. Feel free to try or improve this.
